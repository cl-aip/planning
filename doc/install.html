<H1>Downloading and Installing Lisp Code for Automated Planning</H1>
<P>
This page gives instructions for retrieving the code for the book, and
installing it on your local system.  This installation procedure need
only be followed once.  

<H2>Downloading the Code</H1>
<P>
To download the code, follow these steps:

<OL>
<LI> Create a directory where you want the code to reside, and change to that directory.
On Unix, this might be "<tt>mkdir &lt;<I>planning</I>&gt;; cd &lt;<I>planning</I>&gt</tt>".

<LI> </b>Download the planning system</b>. The easiest way is to click on
this link to get <a href="../planning.zip">planning.zip</a> (154KB).    

<LI> Execute the command, on Unix, <tt>unzip planning.zip</tt>, or on Windows, 
drag the planning.zip file to a program such as WinZip.
to unpack the archive of files.  
</OL>

<H2>Installing a Lisp Interpreter/Compiler</H2>
<P>
There are many available Lisp compilers that you can use.  However, we 
have tested the code only the following:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.franz.com/downloads/">Franz
Allegro Common Lisp</a> for Windows.
</ul>
<P>We hope that someone ports the program to any other Lisp system. 
<P>
If you have no Allegro CL system, you can install the evaluation version from 
<a href="http://www.franz.com/downloads/">Franz Inc</a>. 
It is free but some months later you will be required to respond the query when starting lisp system 
whether you upgrade or not. However, you can continue to use it 
with replying "CONTINUE". 
<H3>How to change character mode:</H3>
We always use ACL in modern mode (character case sensitive), in which
lisp system distinguishes upper-case letters and lower-case letters. 
We recommend to follow the instruction below in order to set up modern mode for 
the evaluation version.  If you purchase ACL, the choice of character modes is just menu selection 
in Windows version. 

<OL>
<LI>Run original aclxx-express.
<LI>Execute the following form in Lisp window. You will obtain 'allegro.exe' file under 
'C:\Program Files\acl80-express' folder.
<pre class="box"><code>     (progn
       (build-lisp-image "sys:allegro.dxl" :case-mode :case-sensitive-lower)
       (when (probe-file "sys:allegro.exe") (delete-file "sys:allegro.exe"))
       (sys:copy-file "sys:allegro-ansi.exe" "sys:allegro.exe"))
</code></pre><BR>
<LI>To start Lisp, invoke 'allegro.exe' instead of 'allegro-ansi.exe'. 
In Windows, it is good idea to set up the start menu for 'allegro.exe'. You may copy the start menu folder for 
'allegro-ansi.exe' and revise the link of short-cut file.
</OL>

<H2>Installing the Code</H1>

<OL>
<LI> Make sure you have both read-permission and write-permission for
the directory where the code is kept.

<P><LI> The defsystem program for planning works depending on the file/directory 
structure. Please do not change the relative file/directory structure, but you can 
place anywhere the whole system with keeping the relative file/diretory structure.
Then, use the defsystem program to compile, load, etc.

</OL>

<h2>Running the Code</h2>

The steps above need be done only once;
you  are now ready for the easier process of
<A HREF="user.html">using the code</A>.
