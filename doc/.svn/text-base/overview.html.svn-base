<H1>Overview of Automated Planning Code</H1>
<P>This page serves as the starting point for exploring the online code for
<I>Automated Planning - Theory and Practice</I> by Malik Ghallab, 
Dana Nau, and Paolo Traverso.

<P>This program is coded by Seiji Koide, motivated by the fact that there is no real working codes 
over the Internet on algorithms that are shown in the book. 
The copyrights of algorithms are reserved by Elsevier Inc., but all rights on programs that embody 
algorithm are reserved by Seiji Koide.

<P>Several modules around this program are borrowed from two sources, i.e., <I>On Lisp</I> 
by Paul Graham, and <I>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</I> by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. 
The document generation system by Norvig, which produces documents accompanied for this page, 
is also borrowed and tailored by Seiji Koide to these programs. 
The some of following web pages are automatically and directly generated from Lisp source codes. 
The copyright notice is written in source codes of each module and appears at the beginning of these document, 
whereas I really thank Paul Graham, Peter Norvig, and of cource authors of the book Malik Ghallab, Dana Nau, and Paolo Traverso.

<LI> An <A HREF="entries.html">alphabetical index</A> of all names in the code.
<LI> The <A HREF="../">Lisp source code</A> itself as a browsable directory.
<LI> The following subsystems are organized into subdirectories.<P>
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="overview-utils.html">Utilities</A>: 
Basic functions that are loaded every time, and used by many other planning systems. 
This module includes callcc file for continuous function implementation from <I>On Lisp</I> 
and utilities file from <I>AIMA</I>.
<LI> <A HREF="overview-fol.html">Logic</A>: 
Code from AIMA Part III: Logic, Inference, and Knowledge Representation, but they are a little bit tailored by author. 
<LI> <A HREF="overview-plan.html">Planning</A>: 
Code for <I>Automated Planning - Theory and Practice</I>. This part is the main contribution by author. 
As you know, there is <A HREF="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/lisp/doc/overview-PLANNING.html">no planning part in <I>AIMA</I> Lisp code repository</A>. This module fulfills the 
lack of program code of <I>AIMA</I>.
